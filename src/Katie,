Katie,

As I'm sure you have already heard, Brian and Cheri will be leaving the church for another ministry opportunity.  The Elders are looking to put together a group of leaders for a hiring committee. The committee will be responsible for sifting through candidates and recommending a candidate for hire to the Elder board.  Kevin and I will be a part of this committee, but we are looking for three or four additional leaders in the church that have a passion for our Children's Ministry.  Would you be willing to spend time praying to determine if you should be on this committee?

Thanks,
Shawn
