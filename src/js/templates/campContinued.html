    <p>Join us every Thursday afternoon, beginning July 7th, from 12:30-4pm at Ghent Elementary School (200 Shirley Avenue Norfolk, VA 23517). We will be taking 3rd-5th graders from Tidewater Park Elementary on field trips around the Hampton Roads Area. This is a great way to continue the relationships we have formed at TheCamp!
