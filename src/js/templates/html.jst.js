We are dedicated to furthering the Gospel of \n\t\tJesus Christ through a commitment to the campus of Old Dominion University, the local community, and the world. We are a biblical community dedicated to pursuing God with our lives to see the city transformed by His love. We welcome everyone no matter where you are in your journey with God.  We firmly believe that our focus should never be how good we can be as people, but on the goodness of our God.  \n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tCrossRoads\' provides inviting, relevant and challenging worship services.  We desire to have a different church experience that is refreshing to those who have been burned by church.  Our focus isn\'t building a large organization, but seeing people become fully devoted followers of Christ.  We emphasize the importance community plays in our journey of faith.\n\t</p>\n\t<br class="clear">\n</section>\n\n<section class="alternate">\n\t<a id="mission"></a>\n\t<h2>Mission</h2><br>\n\t<p>\n\t\tCrossRoads\' intent is to be a missional church.  That means that we are not trying to see how large of an organization we can build.  Our goal is to represent God\'s kingdom in all that we do.   The most important ministry we do occurs outside of our building walls.  As we go about life, we want to serve others and be a light to our community wherever we may be.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tCrossRoads Church feels called to the campus of Old Dominion University, the local community and the world.  We support a ministry called YoungLife which ministers to students in middle school, high school and now the campus of ODU. Our main engagement with YoungLife involves the schools in Norfolk, and the ministry we have witnessed has been life changing.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tCrossRoads has also been committed to international ministry.  We have had a long-standing commitment to unreached people groups in Peru. Through mission teams and strategic partners, we have worked to strengthen a local Peruvian church to minister to its own people.  CrossRoads also has a history of sending missionaries to countries all over the world.  We believe that God deeply wants people of all nations to know Him and we have committed ourselves to follow through with what He has called us to do.\n\t</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n\t<a id="beliefs"></a>\n\t<h2>Beliefs</h2><br>\n\t<h3>GOD</h3>\n\t<p class="before-small">\n\t\tWe believe in one God who is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. The eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="small">Genesis 1:1,26,27; 3:22 / Psalm 90:2 / Matthew 28:19 / I Peter 1:2 / II Corinthians 13:14</p>\n\t<h3>MAN</h3>\n\t<p class="before-small">\n\t\tMan is made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. He is the supreme object of God\'s creation. Although man has tremendous potential for good, he is marred by a nature of rebellion toward God called "sin." This sinful nature separates man from God.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="small">Genesis 1:27 / Psalm 8:3-6 / Isaiah 53:6a / Romans 3:23 / Isaiah 59:1-2</p>\n\t<h3>ETERNITY</h3>\n\t<p class="before-small">\n\t\tMan was created to exist forever. He will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or in union with \n\t\tGod, through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally in union \n\t\twith Him is Heaven. Heaven and Hell are places of eternal existence.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="small">John 3:16 / I John 2:25; 5:11-13 / Romans 6:23 / Revelation 20:15</p>\n\t<h3>JESUS CHRIST</h3>\n\t<p class="before-small">\n\t\tJesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Jesus lived a sinless \n\t\thuman life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all men by dying on a cross. He arose \n\t\tfrom the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven\'s glory and \n\t\twill return again to earth to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="small">\n\t\tMatthew 1:22-23 / Isaiah 9:6 / John 1:1-5; 14:10-30 / Hebrews 4:14-15 / I Corinthians 15:3-4 / Romans 1:3-4 / \n\t\tActs 1:9-11 / I Timothy 6:14-15 / Titus 2:13\n\t</p>\n\t<h3>SALVATION</h3>\n\t<p class="before-small">\n\t\tSalvation is a gift from God to man through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. Man can never make up for his sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God\'s offer of forgiveness can man be saved from sin\'s penalty. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith.  One must confess Jesus as the only Lord and Savior to receive the free gift of salvation through Christ.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="small">Romans 6:23 / Ephesians 2:8-9 / John 14:6; 1:12 / Titus 3:5 / Galatians 3:26 / Romans 5:1</p>\n\t<h3>HOLY SPIRIT</h3>\n\t<p class="before-small">\n\t\tThe Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son as God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. The Christian seeks to live under His control daily.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="small">\n\t\tII Corinthians 3:17 / John 16:7-13; 14:16-17 / Acts 1:8 / I Corinthians 2:12; 3:16 / Ephesians 1:13 / Galatians 5:25 / \n\t\tEphesians 5:18\n\t</p>\n \t<h3>THE BIBLE</h3>\n\t<p class="before-small">\n\t\tThe Bible is God\'s Word to all men. It was written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without any mixture of error.\n\t</p>\n\t<p class="small">II Timothy 3:16 / II Peter 1:20-21 / II Timothy 1:13 / Psalm 119:105,160; 12:6 / Proverbs 30:5</p>\n</section>\n\n<section class="alternate" id="learn-sermons">\n\t<a id="sermons"></a>\n\t<h2>Sermons</h2><br>\n\t<p>\n\t\tOne of the best ways to learn more about CrossRoads Church is to listen to some of our past sermons.

It has become a major event in the life of CrossRoads Church - volunteers serving, loving and caring for campers.  This is a primary mercy and justice mission for the church and acts as “VBS” for our CrossRoads kids.  It has spawned summer-long activities that have proven to reduce the loss of learning that traditionally happens over the summer.</p>\n     \n    <p>By ourselves, CrossRoads Church doesn\'t have the resources to serve this expanding ministry.  We have partnered with Trinity Presbyterian, OV Church and several other local organizations to make theCamp a reality every summer.</p>\n     \n    <p>All volunteers are required to attend a 2 hour training prior to the week of theCamp.  Dates for this year are as follows:</p>\n    \n    <ul> \n        <li>June 19th 4 - 6PM at Trinity Presbyterian</li>\n        <li>June 21st 6 - 8PM at P.B. Young Elementary School</li>\n        <li>June 23rd 6 - 8PM at CrossRoads Church</li>\n    </ul>\n     \n    <p>For more information, please contact Clark Taylor – <a href="mailto:clark@crossroadsnorfolk.com">clark@crossroadsnorfolk.com</a></p>\n</section>';
