	<h2>Worship</h2>
	<p>
		CrossRoads offers a contemporary worship service on Sunday mornings at 10:00 am.  These services are geared to be relevant and challenging, helping connect those who attend with the living God.  You do not need to dress up or "make yourself right" in order to attend, but rather come as you are.  We hope to see you there this Sunday morning!

	<h2>Life Groups</h2>
	<p>
		CrossRoads believes that we are all meant to journey through life together in community. God has created in all of us a need to be in community with fellow believers.  Our Life Groups are the perfect way for you to connect within our church.  They are meant to be smaller communities within our church, allowing people to have meaningful conversations and prayer in a more personal setting.
	</p>
	<p>
		CrossRoads' Life Groups are hosted at church members' homes.  Meetings are offered on Sunday, Monday and Thursday nights and we hope that you will try to make it out to one.
