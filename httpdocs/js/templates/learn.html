	<h2>Identity</h2><br>
	<p>
		Crossroads is a small but vibrant church in Norfolk Virginia.  We are dedicated to furthering the Gospel of 
		Jesus Christ through a commitment to the campus of Old Dominion University, the local community, and the world. We welcome 
		everyone no matter where you are in your journey with God.  We firmly believes that our focus should never be 
		how good we can be as people, but how good our God is. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Crossroads' provides inviting, relevant and challenging worship services.  We provide a different church experience
		that is refreshing to those who have been burned by church.  Our focus isn't building a large organization, but seeing 
		people become fully devoted followers of Christ.  We emphasize the importance community plays in our journey of faith.

	<h2>Mission</h2><br>
	<p>
		Crossroads' intent is to be a missional church.  That means that we are not trying to see how large of an organization
		we can build.  Our goal is to represent God's kingdom in all that we do.   The most important ministry we do 
		occurs outside of our building walls.  As we go about life, we want to serve others and be a light to our community
		wherever we are.
	</p>
	<p>
		Crossroads Church feels called to the campus of Old Dominion University, the local community and the world.  We
		support a ministry called YoungLife which ministers to students in middle school, high school and now the campus of ODU.  
		Our main engagement with YoungLife involves the schools in Norfolk, and the ministry we have witnessed has been
		incredible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Crossroads has also been committed to international ministry.  We have had a long-standing commitment to unreached people
		groups in Peru. Through mission teams and strategic partners, we have worked to strengthen a local Peruvian church to minister
		to its own people.  Crossroads also has a history of sending missionaries to countries all over the world.  We believe
		that God deeply wants people of all nations to know him and we have committed ourselves to follow through with what
		he has called us to do.

	<h2>Beliefs</h2><br>
	<h3>GOD</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		We believe in one God who is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. The eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, 
		Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.
	</p>
	<p class="small">Genesis 1:1,26,27; 3:22 / Psalm 90:2 / Matthew 28:19 / I Peter 1:2 / II Corinthians 13:14</p>
	<h3>MAN</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		Man is made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. He is the supreme object of God's creation. 
		Although man has tremendous potential for good, he is marred by a nature of rebellion toward God called "sin." 
		This sinful nature separates man from God.
	</p>
	<p class="small">Genesis 1:27 / Psalm 8:3-6 / Isaiah 53:6a / Romans 3:23 / Isaiah 59:1-2</p>
	<h3>ETERNITY</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		Man was created to exist forever. He will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or in union with 
		God, through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally in union 
		with Him is Heaven. Heaven and Hell are places of eternal existence.
	</p>
	<p class="small">John 3:16 / I John 2:25; 5:11-13 / Romans 6:23 / Revelation 20:15</p>
	<h3>JESUS CHRIST</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Jesus lived a sinless 
		human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all men by dying on a cross. He arose 
		from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven's glory and 
		will return again to earth to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
	</p>
	<p class="small">
		Matthew 1:22-23 / Isaiah 9:6 / John 1:1-5; 14:10-30 / Hebrews 4:14-15 / I Corinthians 15:3-4 / Romans 1:3-4 / 
		Acts 1:9-11 / I Timothy 6:14-15 / Titus 2:13
	</p>
	<h3>SALVATION</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		Salvation is a gift from God to man through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. Man can never make up for his 
		sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God's offer of forgiveness can man be 
		saved from sin's penalty. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith.  One must 
		confess Jesus as the only Lord and Savior to receive the free gift of salvation through Christ.
	</p>
	<p class="small">Romans 6:23 / Ephesians 2:8-9 / John 14:6; 1:12 / Titus 3:5 / Galatians 3:26 / Romans 5:1</p>
	<h3>HOLY SPIRIT</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		The Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son as God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their 
		need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with 
		power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. The Christian seeks to live 
		under His control daily.
	</p>
	<p class="small">
		II Corinthians 3:17 / John 16:7-13; 14:16-17 / Acts 1:8 / I Corinthians 2:12; 3:16 / Ephesians 1:13 / Galatians 5:25 / 
		Ephesians 5:18
	</p>
 	<h3>THE BIBLE</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		The Bible is God's Word to all men. It was written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. 
		It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without 
		any mixture of error.
	</p>
	<p class="small">II Timothy 3:16 / II Peter 1:20-21 / II Timothy 1:13 / Psalm 119:105,160; 12:6 / Proverbs 30:5</p>
