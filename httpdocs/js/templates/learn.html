	<h2>Beliefs</h2><br>
	<h3>GOD</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		We believe in one God who is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. The eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, 
		Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.
	</p>
	<p class="small">Genesis 1:1,26,27; 3:22 / Psalm 90:2 / Matthew 28:19 / I Peter 1:2 / II Corinthians 13:14</p>
	<h3>MAN</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		Man is made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. He is the supreme object of God's creation. 
		Although man has tremendous potential for good, he is marred by a nature of rebellion toward God called "sin." 
		This sinful nature separates man from God.
	</p>
	<p class="small">Genesis 1:27 / Psalm 8:3-6 / Isaiah 53:6a / Romans 3:23 / Isaiah 59:1-2</p>
	<h3>ETERNITY</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		Man was created to exist forever. He will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or in union with 
		God, through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally in union 
		with Him is Heaven. Heaven and Hell are places of eternal existence.
	</p>
	<p class="small">John 3:16 / I John 2:25; 5:11-13 / Romans 6:23 / Revelation 20:15</p>
	<h3>JESUS CHRIST</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Jesus lived a sinless 
		human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all men by dying on a cross. He arose 
		from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven's glory and 
		will return again to earth to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
	</p>
	<p class="small">
		Matthew 1:22-23 / Isaiah 9:6 / John 1:1-5; 14:10-30 / Hebrews 4:14-15 / I Corinthians 15:3-4 / Romans 1:3-4 / 
		Acts 1:9-11 / I Timothy 6:14-15 / Titus 2:13
	</p>
	<h3>SALVATION</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		Salvation is a gift from God to man through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. Man can never make up for his 
		sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God's offer of forgiveness can man be 
		saved from sin's penalty. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith.  One must 
		confess Jesus as the only Lord and Savior to receive the free gift of salvation through Christ.
	</p>
	<p class="small">Romans 6:23 / Ephesians 2:8-9 / John 14:6; 1:12 / Titus 3:5 / Galatians 3:26 / Romans 5:1</p>
	<h3>HOLY SPIRIT</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		The Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son as God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their 
		need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with 
		power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. The Christian seeks to live 
		under His control daily.
	</p>
	<p class="small">
		II Corinthians 3:17 / John 16:7-13; 14:16-17 / Acts 1:8 / I Corinthians 2:12; 3:16 / Ephesians 1:13 / Galatians 5:25 / 
		Ephesians 5:18
	</p>
 	<h3>THE BIBLE</h3>
	<p class="before-small">
		The Bible is God's Word to all men. It was written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. 
		It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without 
		any mixture of error.
	</p>
	<p class="small">II Timothy 3:16 / II Peter 1:20-21 / II Timothy 1:13 / Psalm 119:105,160; 12:6 / Proverbs 30:5</p>
