		and we meet in the building Larchmont Baptist Church used to congregate.  You may click the image to the right

		Crossroads does not have an official parking lot which is typical of most places in Norfolk. We invite newcomers
		and members with young kids to use street parking along Surrey Crescent.  If you get there late, you may also find
		parking available along Jamestown Crescent and Monroe Place.
