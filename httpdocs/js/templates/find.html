		CrossRoads Church is located in the Larchmont area of Norfolk, Virginia.  Our address is 1127 Surrey Crescent 
		and we meet in the building Larchmont Baptist Church used to congregate.  You may click the image to the right
		in order to pull up driving directions using Google Maps.

	<p>
		CrossRoads does not have an official parking lot which is typical of most places in Norfolk. We invite newcomers
		and members with young kids to use street parking along Surrey Crescent.  If you get there late, you may also find
		parking available along Jamestown Crescent and Monroe Place.
